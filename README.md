# CS50x-2020

These are my solutions to the problem sets of [Harvard's CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)

> A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/honesty/). While these solutions will help you to get through the course without too much effort, you should do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any of my solutions. Investing your time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is in my opinion the only way to eventual mastery.
