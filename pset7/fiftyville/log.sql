-- Ruth | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft,
-- I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking
-- lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the
-- courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars
-- that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- Eugene | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone
-- I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the
-- courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and
-- saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- Raymond | As the thief was leaving the courthouse,
-- they called someone who talked to them for less than
-- a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were
-- planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville
-- tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end
-- of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
